# Vending Machine - Java Play App

This simple model of a vending machine is made with the Play! framework (v. 2.6) with Java, Scala, and Sqlite3 database with Ebean ORM. To start the program, Java, sbt (v. 1.0.4), jdk (v. 1.8), and sqlite3 must be installed on your machine. If these are installed, the command to run the application is `sbt run`.

When run for the first time the database will be empty. To add an item, go to the Service page and click on items, and click the link to add items to the database.
